# Data-Science-Projects
Data Science Projects on various datasets and competitions.
- Regression
- Classifcation

Note: In every competition, There are 5 jupyter notebooks. I learn from the first 4 versions and try what i learned on the 5th.
Sometimes I will write directly what i learned :-P
The notebooks that i learn from are the most voted on kaggle platform and i write the authors names on the very first cell.
